object AE {
  // Abstract Syntax Tree
  sealed trait Expression // we use "sealed" to get completeness checks for pattern matching
  case class Literal(n: Int) extends Expression
  case class Addition(lhs: Expression, rhs: Expression) extends Expression

  // Example
  val ex = Addition(Literal(1), Addition(Literal(5), Literal(3)))

  // Interpreter

/* 
 * In this lecture we want to study the technique of desugaring as a means
 * to structure programming languages and decompose a language into a
 * core language and syntactic sugar.
 * 
 * For illustration, consider the following proposed extensions to the language:
 *  1. Multiplication
 *  2. Subtraction
 *  3. Unary Negation 
 *
 * Extension number 1 is a good example for a core language extension.
 * We have no way of expressing multiplication in terms of the existing 
 * constructs (if we had some looping construct we could express multiplication
 * as repeated addition but we do not have loops).
 * 
 * Hence we add this language construct to the (core) language:

/* Let us now consider extension #2, subtraction. One way to support subtraction is

/* However, another way of adding subtraction is to treat it as syntactic sugar
 * using the fact that a - b = a + (-1 * b)
 *
 * One way of expressing the desugaring is as a syntax transformation: */

    MAE.Addition(desugarSMAE2MAE(lhs), 
                 MAE.Multiplication(MAE.Literal(-1),desugarSMAE2MAE(rhs)))
}

/* With this desugaring in place, we do not need an interpreter for SMAE anymore; rather
 *, we can reuse the MAE interpreter: */

val res = MAE.eval(desugarSMAE2MAE(SMAE.ex))

/* If we had written other algorithms on MAE, or had proven properties of MAE, they'd be applicable
 * to SMAE, too. Hence desugaring is a way of reusing code, proofs, ... .
 * It is important, though, that the desugared language feature is gone after desugaring.
 * For instance, a pretty printer would print the desugared code. A debugger would use
 * the desugared code. This can be an important downside to desugaring. There are ways
 * to avoid or mitigate these shortcomings, but they require additional work.
 *
 * There is a second way of realizing desugaring which does not require the definition of
 * a copy of the AST classes. We can desugar earlier, namely during the construction of the AST:
